# collect
COLLECT - The 'Feature Collection Model' is used to represent a collection of GML feature instances of the same type of meteorological
information.  The intent is to allow XML encoded meteorological information to be packaged in a way that emulates the existing data
distribution practices used within the WMO Information System (WIS) and Aeronautical Fixed System (AFS).

Notes:
1. The collection of meteorological information is often referred to as a bulletin.
2. XML encodings of meteorological information are defined in Part D; for example FM 205-15 EXT IWXXM-XML.
